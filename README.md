# Thai Minimal Pairs

**Thai Minimal Pairs** is a training application designed to help learners improve their Thai listening and pronunciation skills through the practice of minimal pairs. The app plays audio samples of Thai minimal pairs and challenges users to identify the correct word by selecting from two options. Each word is displayed in Thai along with its International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription for accurate pronunciation guidance.

## Features

- **Multiple Categories:**  
  Explore various types of minimal pairs including:

  - Consonant contrasts (e.g., unaspirated vs. aspirated, voiced vs. unvoiced, sibilant sounds)
  - Vowel contrasts (short vs. long vowels, front vs. back vowels)
  - Tone differences
  - Final consonant variations

- **Interactive Practice:**  
  Listen to an audio sample of one word from a pair and choose the matching word. Immediate feedback is provided:

  - ✓ Correct!
  - ✗ Incorrect

- **IPA Transcriptions:**  
  Each word is accompanied by its IPA transcription, making it easier to understand and master the pronunciation.

- **Offline Desktop App:**  
  Packaged with Electron, this app can be downloaded and run offline as a standalone desktop application.
